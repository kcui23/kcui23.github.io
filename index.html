                <li>After analyzing and processing more than 150,000 data entries, a prediction model based on the Tree
                    Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) algorithm was developed. It was demonstrated that this model is
                    significantly better than previous models based on logistic regression and decision tree algorithms.
                    The model can effectively identify potential loan defaulters.</li>
